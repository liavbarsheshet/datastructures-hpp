# C++ Generic Linked List

Abstract interface of Iterator.

---

## Declaration

Supports >= c++11:

```c++
#include "iterator.hpp"

class Iterator : public DS_HPP::Iterator<T,Number,Iterator>;
```

## Template

```c++
/**
 * Represents a generic iterator abstract interface.
 *
 * @tparam T - The type of element.
 * @tparam Derived - The derived class implementing the iterator.
 * @tparam Size - Class or primitive Size type for index representation (DEFAULT: int).
 */
template<typename T, typename Derived, typename Number>
class DS_HPP::Iterator {
...
}
```

## Methods

Represents Hash Table (Double Hashing).

 * Constructor: Creates an iterator with a specific pointer to an element.
